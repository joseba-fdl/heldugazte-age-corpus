# Heldugazte-age corpus
80k tweets in Basque for life-stage (young/adult) identification of Basque social media users. 

## Data
Heldugazte-Age, contains 80,000 tweets from 1,000 users equally distributed into the young and adult classes. 
The data was splitted for experimentation into a training (60%), development (20%) and test (20%) set, resulting, for each class, in 24K tweets for training and 8K for development and test, respectively:
+ hg_train.tsv, containing 48,0000 annotated tweets for training.
+ hg_dev.tsv, containing 16,0000 annotated tweets for development.
+ hg_test.tsv, containing 16,0000 annotated tweets for testing.

The data of the corpus consists on the class and the text of the tweet. The class is young (gazte) or adult (heldu). This corpus was used to train and test classifiers for life-stage detection of Basque speaking Twitter users.
